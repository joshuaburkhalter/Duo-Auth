.CLZ and .USP are Crestron files and do not need to be included in the VS2019 build.

This is a module to hit the Duo Auth API from a Crestron processor (4-series).  You will need a Duo Auth hostname, secret key and integration key.  It's a very slow compile in SIMPL so I would recommend adding it after your program is done and you don't have much troubleshooting left to do.

This is currently only set up for PUSH notifications via Duo.
